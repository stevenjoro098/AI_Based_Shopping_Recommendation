- AI-driven data analysis for better accuracy
- Scalable and efficient implementation
- Real-time updates and adaptive learning
- Easy integration with existing systems

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **API**: Django REST Framework (DRF)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-recommender.git
   cd ai-recommender
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
